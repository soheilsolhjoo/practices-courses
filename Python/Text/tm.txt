All these ancient skulls have perfectly straight teeth,
0:10
despite almost certainly never sporting braces.
0:14
And this isn't some strange sample.
0:16
According to the fossil record,
0:18
ancient humans usually had straight teeth,
0:21
complete with third molars— or wisdom teeth.
0:24
In fact, the dental dilemmas that fuel the demand for braces
0:28
and wisdom teeth extractions today appear to be recent developments.
0:34
So what happened?
0:35
While it's nearly impossible to know for sure,
0:38
scientists have a hypothesis.
0:41
A couple million years ago,
0:42
the ancestors of modern humans lived a subsistence lifestyle.
0:47
Their teeth and jaws had to work hard to make the food they ate digestible.
0:52
Indeed, the surfaces of many of their teeth show extensive wear and flattening.
0:58
They also had larger jaws and teeth overall.
1:01
At some point, they began using tools and fire to cook and prepare food,
1:07
which helped break it down.
1:09
A lot more time passed and, around 12,000 years ago,
1:13
some humans started farming and domesticating animals and plants.
1:18
Over the course of several thousand years,
1:21
it became more common for people to process and refine their food.
1:25
Milling technologies helped remove the tougher parts of grains,
1:29
like the germ and bran from rice and wheat.
1:33
Fast forward to the industrial Revolution,
1:36
and technological innovations dramatically accelerated these processes.
1:41
In a relatively short time,
1:43
many human mouths were relieved of a great deal
1:46
of their grinding, crushing, and pulverizing duties.
1:49
And interestingly, it was around this time
1:52
that tooth crookedness appears to have become more common.
1:57
Examining fossils spanning millions of years of evolution,
2:01
researchers have observed a gradual decrease in tooth and jaw size
2:06
in humans and our ancestors.
2:09
Many think that, for most of human history,
2:11
dietary shifts— like the introduction of meat and the advent of cooking—
2:16
were gradual,
2:17
and that changes in tooth and jaw size basically kept pace with one another.
2:22
But with the more recent revolutions in agricultural and culinary habits,
2:28
that relationship changed.
2:30
As the theory goes, over a relatively short period,
2:34
some human populations saw a decrease in jawbone size,
2:38
while teeth stayed roughly the same size,
2:41
meaning they're left vying for limited space.
2:44
When they do grow in, they may displace others
2:47
and get jostled into some eccentric positions.
2:51
And then wisdom teeth, which are usually the last to make their debut,
2:55
seem to only complicate things further.
2:58
In many cases, they have little or no space to emerge.
3:02
This can lead to impacted wisdom teeth,
3:05
which may cause discomfort and infections if not surgically removed.
3:10
So larger jaws appear to be associated with greater chewing demands.
3:15
And many scientists think that as people's diets have become less chewy,
3:20
their jaws have gotten smaller— and that this has led to dental crowding,
3:25
resulting in dental crookedness and impacted wisdom teeth.
3:30
This hypothesis has been supported by some preliminary experimental data.
3:34
In a 1983 study, researchers raised 43 squirrel monkeys
3:39
on diets of either naturally tough or artificially soft food.
3:45
Those fed softer food had more crowded premolars,
3:49
rotated or displaced teeth, and narrower dental arches.
3:54
And a 2004 study similarly observed that hyraxes raised on cooked foods
4:00
experienced roughly 10% less growth in facial areas involved in chewing
4:07
compared to those given raw and dried foods.
4:10
In other words, the issue at large seems to be environmental—
4:15
or one of lifestyle— instead of a genetic one,
4:18
though heritable factors may be at play in some instances.
4:23
It's estimated that somewhere between 30 to 60% of people today
4:27
experience some level of tooth crowding.
4:30
But this trend varies across global populations.
4:34
Some people naturally never have wisdom teeth.
4:37
And some don't experience tooth crowding or crookedness
4:40
and still get their wisdom teeth without a hitch.
4:43
This seems to coincide with diets that are less processed.
4:48
So how can we prevent tooth crowding early,
4:51
using lifestyle changes and orthodontics?
4:54
Well, it's certainly something to chew over.
