One



The cement floor is cold.
You grab my hands, gazing at the ceiling.
I will paint the room for you.

We are sitting on a green field,
resting under the warm sun,
and chirping birds
"Not now, my dear.
I loathe poetry."

Your shoulders tremble in silence,
and I, desperately, try to endure the flood. 
Two



I have heard that in old times,
publishers were selling only the inner pages
to bookshops and libraries,
who were making their own covers.
Perhaps this one was covered by the hands of a heavy smoker.

I always enjoyed walking
through bookshelves in libraries:
to look at the covers,
take a book, leaf it, open a page by chance,
and read a paragraph or two.
Strangers are not as generous as books.
I was walking once on a route in the woods,
damp but not muddy.
And out of gray or green, a lean man showed up.
"See these leaves?
With a pot of boiling water, you'll drink exotic tea.
What else would you want for an evening?"
And it was an hour before noon.

What else would I want?
I would want to walk through the isles
of bookshelves in a library.
Or to continue walking
in the woods,
wondering how these green leaves
have transformed
into those white leaves.
 
Three



The train station is full of people
wearing masks.
This evening a human decided
to stop a train with bodily forces,
And proved to be determined,
by jumping in front of one.

Now, three hours later,
still no train passes that path.
That human was indeed mighty.
 
Another hour passes.
A train shows up from far.
The station vibrates.
An old couple, holding hands, tries not to swing.
The train stops.
Upon opening the gates, the flood rushes in.
The old couple, fixated by hands,
cannot take a step.
The train shrieks.

An apparent rover
with a backpack
wobble to an open door
but looks around
as if a drunk person sees a fire engine in his last hours
for the very first time.
People encourage him to move forward and enter the train.
The rover finally decides to do so,
but a girl shouts: "Wait! That's my backpack!"

More than a hundred remain for the next-hour train.
You take my hand.
"Was the rover a thief?"
And I look into your eyes and think
were we anywhere else
what else would I do
but enjoying your presence.

Ships float over the river of time.
And time flows under the ever-enduring friendships.
 
Five: war



Those flower buds had a message of spring.
Yesterday was a sunny day in late winter.

Walking through the city, I saw:
a laughing couple
leaving an estate agency
signed the contract of their future house,
twelve young boys and girls
speeding on their bikes
to a dance club or a library,
an angry aged woman
missing the postman with a letter
from her grandmother,
and two ordinary men, hand in hand
nothing special about them
except for their shining smiles.

And that baby in a stroller
laughing at me.
She had no words in mind
to structure her thoughts, like me, 
when I think on invasion.

All those who I met yesterday
are in a sudden imposed sleep,
the reality of shattered lives.
Today is a gloomy day in late winter.
These closed eyes have a message of war.
 
Six: invasion



The night is trembling with doubts,
predictable yet uncertain.
 
The nights before were not that different.
Debts to be paid,
groceries to be bought,
vaccines to be shot,
flowers to be smelled,
lips to be kissed,
feet to be rubbed,
friends to be hugged,
paintings to be watched,
and words...

Today, the sun rises to a day
grayed with the words declaring an invasion.
And a smile is heavier than ever
when a child gazes into your eyes,
looking for colors
to draw a ship filled with friends. 
Seven



Spring has arrived,
with a full moonshine,
and a cheerful song.

Persians have celebrated,
and the celebration of flowers has colored the ground,
trees have grown bright leaves,
the river is roaring in excitement,
Sun is out more these days,
giving people a mood to smile,
at least to all who I see.
You always saw those unseen,
captivated, bombed,
suffered to their bone.

I see these all coming from not being:
none were in Winter.
But you always saw them recurring:
the same flowers as last Spring.

Now, for me, the only unseen is you.
Will you ever reoccur?
Will you ever return?
But where to return?
The home you were living in,
which torn down
while you were living in?


Time is not a loop.
The most compassionate,
the most merciful,
the black soil,
embraces you,
swallows you,
keeps you waiting for me to join.
Eventually!
And then, you'll smile and say:
Ah! You returned!

You are Spring,
and I'm your sweating Summer.
Flow your rivers on me.

Woke up from a hallucinated dream,
within a medicined sleep,
I saw a picture you took for me
from a tree filled with blossoms.
What a loss!



Did I miss
the chirping birds,
the fresh smell of the trees,
the entangled white and blue
on a sunny day,
the walk with you?
Sure, I did.
 
Yet, the utmost miss is to have you
laid down beside me
your head resting on my breast
my fingers combing your hair.
I would listen to your soothing voice
telling me of your today's walk
on how you saw
that tree filled with blossoms
or your newly befriended ladybug.
Then, we both would go for a nap.

If only I wasn't a sweating Summer
before a sunny Spring.

This city doesn't have a boulevard, or
a skyscraper, or
an ever Spring garden.

I love its tall old gray tower, and its ever-singing carillon.
I love the rain, and it's a rainy city.
I love the wind, and it's a windy city.
I love rivers, and a river has embraced the city.
I love you, and this city has never seen you, nor ever will.
If I go anywhere else,
anywhere but Shiraz,
that's the same.
You flow wherever I walk,
when birds sing,
when blossoms bloom,
when kids play in the streets,
when a white snail takes half a day to pass a bridge that takes only ten seconds of me,
when a mother huil in grief,
when a son grows up with vague memories,
when the earth shakes,
when I sleep.

You are with me in them all,
as you're alive in the words of those who commemorate you,
as you're alive in the memories,
my memories. 
Ten



I had a few best friends,
one at a time,
who made me talkative.
I was reticent
without them around;
I've spent years in a cave of silence.

You were the first who entered my cave,
and ever since, we have been the closest friends.
I had close friends before,
but I had reserved empty a spot for the closest one.
 
Now with you,
I talk,
I listen,
I smell,
I see,
I taste,
I think,
I cook,
I touch,
I grow,
I plan,
and everything has become more vibrant.

Avidly, I capture every moment
that we spend on weaving our life.
And I scarcely dream.
I scarcely have time to dream.
I scarcely ever wish to dream,
as I live instead.
I live my dream life. 
 
Eleven: four-season blanket

Autumn is on the corner.
Not hot, not cold.
We have started using our blanket,
although you never gave up
It's a four-season blanket.
What is a four-season blanket?
I woke up the other night
sinking in the sweat-soaked mattress.
Four-season blanket?
What is a four-season blanket?

Yesterday, I lay down in our library.
A vibrant light was reflected on the ceiling,
coloring yellow the white.
My childhood home had a white ceiling, too,
with sunlight reflections from the watered backyard.
I used to lay down on the carpet,
after playing with my toy cars,
or speeching myself on how to ride the swing,
or building a cave with cushions,
or simply because I had to rest
for I had my leg broken.
I used to trace the light with my fingers in the air.
At certain hours in the day, we got sun on the floor
to keep us warm.
We had a four-season blanket there, too.
I'd go for a cold, though.
What is a four-season blanket?

You lay beside me
on our narrow carpet
for a short power nap.
We hugged
and I traced your face lines with my fingers in the air.
We spend our years together,
exploring each other,
crumbling together,
and helping each other to bud again.
We do it every day
we do it all the time
with our wave of tears, laughs, and shouts
For we know the answer.
We know the answer.
 
Twelve: mourning

In morning
you wake up
crimson
the color of youth,
liveliness,
denial of death

Death
burning to color itself, its void, all that it is,
with your crimson
catches your hair
sucks life
from your face, eyes, lips, wrists, nails
from your guts, skull, spine
from your heart
and splashes the crimson
on to the open lustful eyes and mouths
of its abominable followers
foes of life, foes of existence

You watered us too
unwillingly for us both
and carved your smile into our memories.
Oh, you who will sit on the trial,
don’t forget to laugh hard and dance.
For now and till then,
we mourn in boiling blood.
 
Thirteen

We strode and strolled, for years and years,
no matter how harsh the wind was.
As we reached the shores of the promised strand,
She whispered
the names of the overseas butterflies.

No land in sight, I was on a boat,
gazing at the setting sun.
Sinking, I was, in my untapped desires.
A phoenix chanted,
and ever since, we’re dancing as one.
