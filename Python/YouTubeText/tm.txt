From the 1650s through the late 1800s,
0:10
European colonists descended on South Africa.
0:14
First, Dutch and later British forces sought to claim the region for themselves,
0:19
with their struggle becoming even more aggressive
0:21
after discovering the area’s abundant natural resources.
0:25
In their ruthless scramble,
0:27
both colonial powers violently removed numerous Indigenous communities
0:31
from their ancestral lands.
0:34
Yet despite these conflicts,
0:35
the colonizers often claimed they were settling in empty land
0:39
devoid of local people.
0:41
These reports were corroborated in letters and travelogues
0:44
by various administrators, soldiers, and missionaries.
0:48
Maps were drawn reflecting these claims,
0:50
and prominent British historians supported this narrative.
0:54
Publications codifying the so-called Empty Land Theory
0:57
had three central arguments.
0:59
First, most of the land being settled by Europeans
1:02
had no established communities or agricultural infrastructure.
1:06
Second, any African communities that were in those regions
1:10
had actually entered the area at the same time as Europeans,
1:13
so they didn’t have an ancestral claim to the land.
1:16
And third, since these African communities had probably stolen the land
1:20
from earlier, no-longer-present Indigenous people,
1:23
the Europeans were within their rights to displace these African settlers.
1:27
The problem is that all three of these arguments were completely false.
1:32
Almost none of this land was empty and Africans had lived here for millennia.
1:37
Indigenous South Africans simply had a different practice
1:40
of land ownership from the Dutch and British.
1:43
Land belonged to families or groups, not individuals.
1:47
And even that ownership was more focused
1:49
on the land’s agricultural products than the land itself.
1:53
Community leaders would distribute seasonal land rights,
1:56
allowing various nomadic groups to graze cattle or forage for vegetation.
2:01
Even the groups that did live in large agricultural settlements
2:04
didn’t believe they owned the land as private property.
2:07
But the colonizing Europeans had no respect for this system of ownership.
2:11
They concluded the land belonged to no one
2:14
and could therefore be divided amongst themselves.
2:18
In this context, claims that the land was “empty”
2:21
were an ignorant oversimplification of a much more complex reality.
2:26
But the Empty Land Theory allowed British academics to rewrite history
2:30
and minimize native populations.
2:33
In 1894, the European parliament in Cape Town
2:36
took this exploitation even further by passing the Glen Grey Act.
2:41
This decree made it functionally impossible
2:43
for native Africans to own land,
2:46
shattering the system of collective tribal ownership
2:48
and creating a class of landless people.
2:51
To justify the theft, Europeans painted the locals as barbarians
2:56
who lacked the capacity for reason
2:58
and were better off being ruled by the colonizers.
3:01
This strategy of stripping locals of their right to ancestral lands
3:05
and casting native people as savages has been employed by many colonizers.
3:10
Now known as the Empty Land Myth,
3:12
this is a well-established technique in the colonial playbook,
3:16
and its impact can be found in the history of many countries,
3:19
including Australia, Canada, and the United States.
3:23
And in South Africa, the influence of this narrative can be traced
3:27
directly to a brutal campaign of institutionalized racism.
3:32
Barred from their lands,
3:34
the once self-sufficient population struggled as migrant laborers and miners
3:38
on European-owned property.
3:41
The law forbade them from working certain skilled jobs,
3:44
and forced Africans to live in racially segregated areas.
3:47
Over time, these racist policies intensified,
3:50
mandating separation in urban areas,
3:53
restricting voting rights, and eventually building to apartheid.
3:58
Under this system, African people had no voting rights,
4:01
and the education of native Africans was overhauled
4:05
to emphasize their legal and social subservience to white settlers.
4:10
This state of legally enforced racism persisted through the early 1990s,
4:15
and throughout this period,
4:16
colonists frequently invoked the Empty Land Theory
4:19
to justify the unequal distribution of land.
4:23
South African resistance movements fought throughout the 20th century
4:26
to gain political and economic freedom.
4:30
And since the 1980s, South African scholars have been using
4:33
archaeological evidence to correct the historical record.
4:37
Today, South African schools are finally teaching the region's true history.
4:42
But the legacy of the Empty Land Myth still persists
4:45
as one of the most harmful stories ever told.
