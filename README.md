# practices-courses

This is a collection of various projects I exercised with to practice different topics. The codes are written in different languages.

# Projects

## [Algorithms](https://github.com/soheilsolhjoo/practices-courses/tree/main/Algorithms)
This is a small collection of practices from the book [Algorithms For Dummies](https://www.dummies.com/book/technology/information-technology/data-science/general-data-science/algorithms-for-dummies-281625/). The codes are in Python.
+ Factorial
+ Search by midpoint
+ Fild path in graphs
+ Naive sorting

## Python
+ [Word Cloud](https://github.com/soheilsolhjoo/practices-courses/tree/main/Python/WordCloud): this is the final project of the course **Crash Course on Python** by *Google* on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-crash-course/). Obviously, the code is in Python.
+ [Hangman](https://github.com/soheilsolhjoo/practices-courses/tree/main/Python/Hangman): a simple game of hangman.

## [Machine Learning on Coursera](https://github.com/soheilsolhjoo/practices-courses/tree/main/ML_Coursera)
These are the files from the **Machine Learning** course by *Andrew Ng*, which was available on Coursera (and isn't anymore). The videos of the course can be found in YouTube, e.g., [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLssT5z_DsK-h9vYZkQkYNWcItqhlRJLN). In each session (of 8 sessions in total), a topic was taught, and for practicing that, some starting (and incomplete) codes were provided, which should be completed by the students to make the code running. This collection is my tries to complete and run the codes. The codes are in MATLAB.

\*The videos of the new series can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxfEOJXRm7eZKJyovNH-lE3ooXTsOCvfC).

## [Image Processing with MATLAB](https://github.com/soheilsolhjoo/practices-courses/tree/main/ImageProcessing_MATLAB)
This is my try for the final project of the **Image Processing for Engineering and Science Specialization** provided by MATLAB on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/image-processing). The specialization consists of three courses:
+ Introduction to Image Processing
+ Image Segmentation, Filtering, and Region Analysis
+ Automating Image Processing

The goal of the final project was to identify moving cars on a road.

## [p5js](https://github.com/soheilsolhjoo/practices-courses/tree/main/p5j)
This is the collection of my practices with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), a JavaScript library.

## [Keras-TensorFlow](https://github.com/soheilsolhjoo/practices-courses/tree/main/Keras-TensorFlow)
+ These are the practiced codes for the course **Practical AI with Python and Reinforcement Learning** by Jose Portilla on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/practical-ai-with-python-and-reinforcement-learning/).
  + [FFNN: Syntax Basics](https://github.com/soheilsolhjoo/practices-courses/blob/main/Keras-TensorFlow/00-Keras-Syntax-Basics.ipynb)
  + [FFNN: Regression](https://github.com/soheilsolhjoo/practices-courses/blob/main/Keras-TensorFlow/01-Keras-Regression.ipynb)
  + [FFNN: Classification](https://github.com/soheilsolhjoo/practices-courses/blob/main/Keras-TensorFlow/02-Keras-Classification.ipynb)
  + Assessment: [FFNN: Predict House Price for House Sales in King County, USA](https://github.com/soheilsolhjoo/practices-courses/blob/main/Keras-TensorFlow/03-Keras-Project-Exercise.ipynb)
  + [CNN: Image Classification - MNIST data](https://github.com/soheilsolhjoo/practices-courses/blob/main/Keras-TensorFlow/CNN-mnist.ipynb)
  + [CNN: Image Classification - CIFAR 10 data](https://github.com/soheilsolhjoo/practices-courses/blob/main/Keras-TensorFlow/CNN-cifar10.ipynb)
  + [CNN: Image Classification - Real Images - Malaria Detection](https://github.com/soheilsolhjoo/practices-courses/blob/main/Keras-TensorFlow/Malaria%20Detection.ipynb)
  + Assessment: [CNN: Image Classification - FASHION MNIST](https://github.com/soheilsolhjoo/practices-courses/blob/main/Keras-TensorFlow/04-DL-CV-Assessment.ipynb)
